Ideas and stuff like that
--------

The new Mopify has to be more than just a Mopidy client. It has to be a real web application that provides a complete experience. To realize this effect I want the player to have extra features like a Radio mode. 
Since I'm a big fan of Spotify and their API I want to focus on a combination of Mopidy with Mopidy-Spotify. We can use several APIs to get faster results and a better experience. 

Features
---------
Features that should included be definitly in the new Mopify:

* Radio mode - Create a queue based on the given artist, album, track or genre (echonest)
* Artist information 
* Rich album/artist graphics
* Playlists 
* Improved searching with Spotify
* Consider if it still has to be spotify only. Will have impact on the 'improved searching with spotify' item.
* Use the spotify api to edit playlists (if possible with redirect_uri)
